## User Story

This is a portfolio to showcase future work and personal projects to potential employers. Currently, there are three projects showcased on the page. I will continue to improve upon this page as I build my skillset and add projects as I learn new skills throughout this course.

It is built using HTML, CSS, & Javascript. I newly added a dark mode toggle switch, and a recently updated timestamp to the bottom of the page. There is also an updated media query to be more responsive and mobile friendly. Links to Github, LinkedIn, and a resume are also found in the footer of the portfolio.
